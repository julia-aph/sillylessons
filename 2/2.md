# Lesson 2 (WIP)

## Some more prerequisite physics...

### Quaternion

## Third-person camera
When we implement something, we need to know what the task requires. What does a third-person camera require?
* Something to look at: We need a reference to the player’s Transform so we can track the player’s position.
* Distance: It’s good practice to make everything configurable when possible, so this should be a variable.
* Camera rotation: We want to move AND rotate the camera to face the player. This involves mouse movement, rotation, and offset. The sensitivity of the cursor should be configurable too.

How do we fulfill these requirements? Fortunately Unity provides some useful tools to handle most of the math:
* [Quaternion.AngleAxis(float angle, Vector3 axis)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.AngleAxis.html)
* [Transform.LookAt(Transform target, Vector3 worldUp = Vector3.up)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html)
