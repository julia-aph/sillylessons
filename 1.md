# Lesson 1
*meow!*

## Our progress so far:
* The player’s ball can move and look around
* That’s it (but good work still!)

## Objectives:
* Make the camera third-person
* Add jumping
* Add collectible pickups

## Some prerequisite physics
I realized we haven’t talked much about what vectors and quaternions even are. We'll be working with them everywhere so it's SUPER important to know the fundamentals. Starting from the ground up:

### Scalar
Google definition:
> (of a quantity) having only magnitude, not direction.

Magnitude means size, or *scale*. Scalars are quantities that ONLY have scale, like a `float` or `int`. Note that `float` and `int` are signed, so if the sign is used and the value can be either positive or negative, they CAN encode direction in that form. In that case they wouldn't be scalar but 1-dimensional vectors.

### Vector
Google definition:
> a quantity having direction as well as magnitude

When we use vectors in gamedev, we're almost certainly working with their cartesian representation. "Cartesian" just refers to the way each component of the representation is the distance to zero - or the origin - in it's respective spatial dimension.

[Skim through the Unity docs page about vectors for more about vector arithmetic.](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/VectorCookbook.html)

### Quaternion




## Third-person camera
When we implement something, we need to know what the task requires. What does a third-person camera require?
* Something to look at: We need a reference to the player’s Transform so we can track the player’s position.
* Distance: It’s good practice to make everything configurable when possible, so this should be a variable.
* Camera rotation: We want to move AND rotate the camera to face the player. This involves mouse movement, rotation, and offset. The sensitivity of the cursor should be configurable too.

How do we fulfill these requirements? Fortunately Unity provides some useful tools to handle most of the math:
* [Quaternion.AngleAxis(float angle, Vector3 axis)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Quaternion.AngleAxis.html)
* [Transform.LookAt(Transform target, Vector3 worldUp = Vector3.up)](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Transform.LookAt.html)
