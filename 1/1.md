# Lesson 1
*meow!*

## Our progress so far:
* The playerâ€™s ball can move and look around
* Thatâ€™s it (but good work still!)

## Objectives:
* Make the camera third-person
* Add jumping
* Add collectible pickups

## Some prerequisite physics
I realized we havenâ€™t talked much about what vectors and quaternions even are.
We'll be working with them everywhere so it's SUPER important to know the fundamentals.
Starting from the ground up:

### Scalar
Google definition:
> (of a quantity) having only magnitude, not direction.

Magnitude means size, or *scale*.
Scalars are quantities that ONLY have scale, most commonly stored as a `float` or `int`.
Note that `float` and `int` are signed types, so if the result of a calculation can be either positive or negative, they CAN have direction.
In that case they wouldn't represent a scalar quantity but a 1-dimensional vector.

### Vector
Google definition:
> a quantity having direction as well as magnitude

When we use vectors in gamedev, we're almost certainly working with their cartesian representation.
That means each component of a vector is the distance from zero in it's respective spatial dimension.

![Example of a one and two dimensional vector showing the relationship between cartesian components and magnitude](example.png)  
(I just realized the equations in this graphic are wrong because you also need to take the absolute value before you end up with magnitude, whoops LOL)

In Unity, the `Vector3` structure appears EVERYWHERE.
We use vectors to represent position, scale, direction, offset, force, mesh verticies, etc.
If it exists in 3D, it's a vector. 

Manipulating vectors via airthmetic enables us to do a bunch of cool stuff. Like moving!

```cs
[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody))]
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 3;

    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        // Unity's input system abstracts away WASD into the "Horizontal" and "Vertical" axes
        // which range from -1 to +1, making it super convenient to work with.
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 inputDirection = new Vector3(horizontal, 0, vertical);

        // There's a problem with this. If the player presses W and D at the same time,
        // inputDirection would be (1, 0, 1). The magnitude of (1, 0, 1) is the square root of 2,
        // approx 1.4. This would result in the player going 40% faster by moving diagonally
        // which isn't desirable. To make the vector always have a magnitude of 1, we need to
        // normalize it.
        inputDirection.Normalize();

        rb.AddForce(speed * inputDirection, ForceMode.Force);
    }
}
```

In this example, we construct a *unit vector* from the player's WASD input.
A unit vector is just a vector that has a magnitude of 1.
When you multiply a vector by a scalar, the direction stays the same but the magnitude gets multiplied.

When we do `speed * inputDirection` we're creating a force vector to push the player `speed` meters per second in the direction of `inputDirection`.

That's cool and all, but now I'd like to jump!

```cs
[RequireComponent(typeof(Rigidbody))]
public class Player : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float speed = 3;
    public float jumpForce = 5;

    private Rigidbody rb;

    void Start()
    {
        rb = GetComponent<Rigidbody>();
    }

    void FixedUpdate()
    {
        float horizontal = Input.GetAxis("Horizontal");
        float vertical = Input.GetAxis("Vertical");

        Vector3 inputDirection = new Vector3(horizontal, 0, vertical);
        inputDirection.Normalize();

        rb.AddForce(speed * inputDirection, ForceMode.Force);

        if (Input.GetButtonDown("Jump"))
        {
            // Use ForceMode.Impulse to apply the force instantly
            rb.AddForce(jumpForce * Vector3.up, ForceMode.Impulse);
        }
    }
}
```

No new concepts here, we're just multiplying a scalar by a unit vector again to create an upwards force vector.
Jumping only involves going in the up direction, so we can make use of the `Vector3.up` constant which is equal to (0, 1, 0).
Unity provides [a bunch of `Vector3` constants](https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Vector3.html) like that for our convenience.

(sorry I was gonna cover quaternions in this lesson but the explaination for vectors ended up being so lengthy and I've already delayed our lesson so much so so so ðŸ˜­ we'll get to it next time!!!)
